## Desktop only (version one)

Policy: see PRD "Platform: desktop web app".

| Route | Narrower than 1024 px |
|---|---|
| `/` landing page *(planned)* | Fully responsive |
| `/login`, `/signup`, `/signup/organization`, `/waitlist`, `/forgot-password`, `/reset-password/:token`, `/verify-email/:token`, `/invite/:token`, `/waitlist/unsubscribe/:token` | Work (phone-friendly; emailed links are often opened on a phone) |
| Every other route | `DesktopOnly` screen: logo, "Fairpaper works on a computer", one line on why (exams need a full browser), what to open, and **Sign out** |

- A `matchMedia("(min-width: 1024px)")` check, re-evaluated on resize, so widening a window or rotating a tablet lets the user straight in.
- A running exam is never interrupted by a resize: the attempt keeps running and the screen asks to widen the window. Leaving fullscreen is already recorded.

## Primary journeys

**J1. Institution onboarding (owner)**
`/signup/organization` → submit name, email, password → automatic login → `/admin-exams` (empty state "No exams yet") → sidebar **Organization** → copy join code or signup link → share with students.

**J2. Candidate onboarding**
Open `/signup?code=XXXX` → fill in name, email, password (code prefilled) → automatic login → organization selected → `/student-account`.
Without a code: signup → `/organizations` → enter a join code → `/student-account`.

**J3. Create and publish an exam (examiner)**
`/admin-exams` → **New exam** → fill in title, opens/closes, duration → pick questions (searchable) → pick groups (none = everyone) → review integrity switches (all on by default) and the optional violation limit → **Publish** (or **Save draft**) → back to `/admin-exams` with status Scheduled or Live.

**J4. Take an exam (candidate)** ← the critical path
`/student-account` → **Open now** → **Start** → `/exam/:id` **Rules** screen (duration, question count, protections) → **Start exam** (enters fullscreen if required; the timer starts on the server now) → answer questions; the navigator shows answered/flagged → **Submit** → confirm dialog "Submit your exam?" → **Finished** screen (score for objective questions, or "Awaiting grading").

**J4b. Take a per-question timed exam (candidate)**
Rules screen also says "Each question has its own time. You can't go back." → **Start exam** → one question at a time with a question timer (and the overall timer) → answer → **Next** (or the timer ends and the next question opens by itself) → after the last question: Finished. The question map shows progress only; past questions are locked and not clickable.

**J5. Review and grade (examiner)**
`/admin-exams` → click an exam → `/admin-exams/:examId` → tab **Needs review** → risk badge → **Report** (`/admin-integrity/:attemptId`) to see the timeline → back → **Grade** (`/admin-evaluate-answers/:attemptId`) → Correct/Incorrect + comment per answer → the score updates.

**J6. See results (candidate)**
Sidebar **Results** → `/student-exams` → click an exam → `/exam-results/:attemptId`.

## Alternate journeys

| Journey | Path |
|---|---|
| Resume after a reload or crash | `/student-account` → **Continue where you left off** → `/exam/resume/:attemptId` → warning "Your timer has been running" → answers restored → continue |
| Resume after the deadline | Resume → the server submits with reason `time_up` → Finished screen |
| Leave the exam (click outside the window, tab/app switch, fullscreen exit) | The exam blurs and its question text leaves the page → violation recorded → coming back isn't enough: click anywhere on the page or press **Return to the exam** (re-enters fullscreen when required) → the violation chip updates |
| Violation limit reached | The server submits with reason `violations` → Finished screen explaining why |
| Time runs out | The page submits automatically → recorded as `time_up` |
| Cancel submit | The confirm dialog's **Cancel** returns to the exam; nothing changes |
| Unpublish | Exam menu → **Unpublish** → back to Draft; candidates no longer see it |
| Delete exam / questions | Menu → **Delete** → danger confirm dialog → removed |
| Excel import | Question bank → **Import** → choose file → **Preview** (row errors listed) → **Import** → list refreshes |
| Switch organization | Sidebar organization button → `/organizations` → pick one → that organization's home |
| Join another organization | `/organizations` → enter code → it becomes available in the switcher |
| Add staff | Organization → Staff → email, optional name, role → **Add**. With an account: added, and emailed. Without one: account created, invite emailed, row shows **Invite pending** with **Resend invite** (older links stop working) until they set a password |
| Change role / remove member | Organization → Staff → role select / remove (only owners can touch owners; the last owner can't be removed) |
| Regenerate a join code | Organization → Invite → **New code** → confirm → the old code stops working |

## Navigation rules

- **Root redirect** (`/`): signed out → `/login`; signed in with no organization selected → `/organizations`; staff → `/admin-exams`; candidate → `/student-account`.
- **Guards:** a route for another role redirects to `/` (which then routes correctly). `/login` and `/signup` redirect to `/` when already signed in. Unknown URLs → `/`.
- **Legacy:** `/student-profile` → `/profile`.
- **Layout:** signed-in pages use `AppShell`: a fixed left sidebar on desktop (≥ 1024 px); a top bar with a slide-in menu on phones; the menu closes on navigation.
- **Sidebar:** staff: Exams, Question bank, Students, Organization (managers only), Account. Candidates: Exams, Results, Account. Plus the organization switcher, the theme toggle, and Log out.
- **Exam page:** no sidebar (distraction-free). Browser back during an exam leaves the page; the attempt keeps running and can be resumed from the dashboard.
- **Deep links:** every screen has a stable URL; IDs are UUIDs.

## Empty and blocked states

| Screen | State | What the user sees |
|---|---|---|
| Exams (staff) | No exams | "No exams yet" + **New exam** |
| New exam | Empty question bank | "Your question bank is empty" + link to import |
| Question bank | No questions / no matches | "No questions yet" + Import / "No matching questions" |
| Students (staff) | None / no matches | "No students yet" (share the join code) / "No matching students" |
| Organization | No groups / no students | Explains that students without a group see exams open to everyone / "Share the join code from the Invite tab" |
| Exam results | No attempts / filter empty | "No attempts yet" / "Nothing here" |
| Grade answers | Nothing to grade | "Nothing to grade" |
| Integrity report | No events | "No events recorded" |
| Candidate dashboard | No exams | "No exams yet" |
| Candidate results | None | "No results yet" |
| Exam | Not started / expired / already submitted / not published | Error phase with the server message and a link back |
| Exam | Away / back but not clicked in / out of fullscreen | The exam blurred behind a card ("You left the exam", violations so far, how many are left); question text replaced by placeholder bars; a click anywhere returns |
| Any | Wrong role | Redirect to the role's home |
| Any | Offline | Today: save errors shown. *(planned)* offline banner + local queue with retry |
| Any | Session expiring | Token refreshed automatically by `AuthContext`; an expired session means signing in again |

## First-use journey

- **New institution:** organization signup → empty Exams page → Organization page (copy code, create groups) → Question bank (download template, import) → New exam. The Exams page shows a **Get started** checklist (3.10) until all four steps are done: Invite your students · Put them in groups · Add questions · Create your first exam. Each open step has a button to the right page (the next one is highlighted); examiners see "An admin does this" for the two manager steps. It replaces the "No exams yet" card while it shows, and **×** hides it in that browser for that organization. Data: `GET /org/setup` (staff).
- **New candidate:** signup with code → dashboard. Before their first exam, the **Rules** screen explains each protection in plain words and how violations work, before anything is recorded.
- **New staff member:** an owner/admin adds an existing account by email on Organization → Staff. *(planned)* email invitations for people without an account.
