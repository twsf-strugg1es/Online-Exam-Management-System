# 6. Implementation Plan: TestKori

Purpose: give the AI agent an ordered build sequence with checkpoints.
Status: living document · Last updated 2026-10-12 · Tick tasks (`[x]`) when merged.

The product already exists (see "Completed"). Milestones 1–6 take it to a **paid pilot**. Milestones 7–8 come after the pilot.

## How to work through this plan

- Do tasks **in order inside a milestone**, unless the Dependency column allows otherwise. Each task = one PR.
- **Owner/agent:** `agent` = any coding agent; `owner` = the product owner must decide or provide something (accounts, keys, choices).
- **Every task's definition of done also includes:** backend tests pass (`python -m pytest tests/ -q`); for new endpoints, a cross-organization access test; a migration if the schema changed; `npm run build` has zero warnings; the affected docs (02 TRD, 03 App Flow, 05 Schema) are updated.
- **Before moving to the next milestone:** run the app, walk the journeys in [03-APP-FLOW.md](03-APP-FLOW.md) affected by the milestone, verify the related acceptance criteria in [01-PRD.md](01-PRD.md), and record any unresolved issue at the bottom of this file under "Open issues".

## Completed

- [x] Phase 1: security holes fixed (answer keys hidden, ownership checks, Alembic baseline)
- [x] Phase 2: multi-organization restructure (organizations, memberships, roles, groups, join codes)
- [x] Phase 3: exam integrity step 1 (shuffle, fullscreen, violations, auto-submit, integrity report, one attempt per exam) + UI redesign

## Milestone 1: Project setup

| ✓ | ID | Task | Owner | Inputs | Output | Definition of done | Depends on |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [x] | 1.1 | Rename the product to **TestKori** in the UI | agent (+ owner approves the mark) | 04 UI/UX Brief "Assets" | `Logo` in `ui.js`, `AuthLayout` text, `public/index.html` title, `manifest.json`, favicons | No "PorikkhaKori" string left in `frontend/` (`grep -ri porikkha`); the new mark is used in light and dark | — |
| [x] | 1.2 | `.env.example` for backend and frontend | agent | 02 TRD env tables | `backend/.env.example`, `frontend/.env.example` | A fresh clone runs by copying the examples | — |
| [x] | 1.3 | Docker setup | agent | — | `backend/Dockerfile` (+ entrypoint running migrations, non-root, healthcheck), `frontend/Dockerfile` (nginx, SPA fallback, security headers), `docker-compose.yml` (db, api, web), `.gitattributes` (LF everywhere) | CI (task 1.5) builds both images and the compose stack passes `/health`. Local `docker compose up` is optional: the owner's PC runs natively (8 GB RAM). MinIO is added with object storage in 3.5 | 1.2 |
| [x] | 1.4 | `/health` endpoint; remove the "Hello" root | agent | — | `GET /health` checks the DB connection | Returns 200 / 503; test added | — |
| [x] | 1.5 | CI (GitHub Actions) | agent | — | `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: backend tests on SQLite; on PostgreSQL: `alembic upgrade head` on an empty DB, `alembic check` (models match migrations), downgrade + re-upgrade, full test suite; frontend test + build with `CI=true`; Semgrep (blocking); Docker images built and the compose stack health-checked | Every push and PR to `main` runs all jobs; a failing job blocks merging (owner enables branch protection on `main`) | 1.3 |
| [x] | 1.6 | Structured logging; remove the debug prints in `start_exam` | agent | — | JSON logs with request ID, user ID, organization ID | No `print(` in `backend/app` | — |
| [x] | 1.7 | Fix the README (structure, links to the six docs) | agent | — | README | Matches the repo tree | — |
| [x] | 1.11 | Apply design direction A ("Exam paper") to the app | agent | `design/v0/TestKori v0.html`, 04 Brief | Tokens (paper, ink, marker green, red pen), 2–6 px radii, no shadows/blur/pulse; `bubble`, `status-dot`, `tag`, `kbd`, `sheet` classes; app shell rail; auth sheet; exams register; exam page (lettered answer bubbles, bubble question map, slim timer bar, keyboard 1–9 / ← → / F); rules screen; student dashboard | Every screen renders in the new style in light and dark at 1280 × 800; tests and build pass | 1.1 |
| [x] | 1.8 | i18n framework (global readiness) | agent | 02 TRD "Internationalization", 04 Brief "Internationalization rules" | `src/i18n/` (no library: English text is the key, `t()` / `tn()` with `Intl.PluralRules`, `<html lang dir>` synced); every screen's strings wrapped; `errorMessage()` translates server messages; date/number formatters use the chosen language; pseudo-language `?lang=en-XA`; `npm run i18n:extract` writes `src/i18n/strings.json` (515 strings incl. 38 server messages) and CI fails if it's stale | Pseudo-language screenshots of every App Flow screen show no plain English except data and the brand; app looks identical in English | 1.1 |
| [x] | 1.9 | Organization and user locale settings | agent | 05 Schema | Migration `0006_locale_settings`: `country`, `default_language` (default `en`), `timezone` (IANA, default `UTC`), `currency` on organizations; `language` on users. `PATCH /org` changes any of them; org signup starts in the browser's timezone. Organization → Settings has a "Region and language" card; Account has a Language field. Every date shows in the organization's timezone; exam windows add a label (e.g. `GMT+6`) when it differs from the viewer's, and the exam form is entered in it | Exam windows show in the organization's timezone with a label when it differs from the viewer's; tests (`test_locale.py`, `utils.test.js`) | 1.8 |
| [x] | 1.10 | RTL-safe layout | agent | 04 Brief | Every physical utility swapped for its logical one (`ms`/`me`, `ps`/`pe`, `start`/`end`, `text-start`/`text-end`, `border-s`/`border-e`, `rounded-s`/`rounded-e`); `<html dir>` comes from the language catalog; switch knob, select caret and back/forward arrows mirror; exam ←/→ follow the reading direction; test pseudo-language `?lang=en-XB` renders right to left | With `dir="rtl"` forced (`en-XB`), J1–J6 layouts aren't broken (screenshots in the checkpoint report) | 1.8 |

## Milestone 2: Data and auth

| ✓ | ID | Task | Owner | Inputs | Output | Definition of done | Depends on |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [x] | 2.1 | Missing indexes + unique `answers(attempt_id, question_id)` | agent | 05 Schema "Indexes" | Migration `0007_indexes_unique_answers` (deduplicates answers first, keeping the evaluated one) | Upgrade works on a copy of real data; save-answer still upserts | 1.5 |
| [x] | 2.2 | Server-side exam validation | agent | 05 Schema "Data validation" | `ExamCreate` validators | start < end, duration ≥ 1, ≥ 1 question → 422; tests | — |
| [x] | 2.3 | Email sending abstraction | agent; **owner** picks the provider | provider SMTP credentials | `app/notify.py` (`send_email`): `console` (`.eml` files, dev), `memory` (tests), `smtp` (any provider). Owner still picks the provider and sender address (Open issues) | Tests use the memory backend; provider set by env var | — |
| [x] | 2.4 | Password reset | agent | 2.3 | `password_reset_tokens` table (hashed, 30 min, single use); 2 endpoints; `/forgot-password`, `/reset-password/:token` pages | PRD **AC14** passes; tests for reuse, expiry, unknown email | 2.3 |
| [x] | 2.5 | Email verification (soft) | agent | 2.3 | `users.email_verified_at`; verify link; banner until verified | Unverified users can still take exams (pilot) | 2.3 |
| [x] | 2.6 | Rate limiting on `/token`, signup, reset | agent | — | `app/rate_limit.py` (own limiter, see TRD decision): sign-in per IP + failures per account, signup and org signup per IP, join codes per user. Reset gets its limit with 2.4 | Exceeding the limit → 429 with `Retry-After`; `test_rate_limit.py` | — |
| [x] | 2.7 | Archive instead of destroy | agent | 05 Schema "Retention" | `questions.archived_at`, `exams.archived_at`; delete = archive once used | Deleting a used question never removes answers; past results still render; tests | 2.1 |
| [x] | 2.8 | JWT subject = user ID (accept old email tokens for one release) | agent | — | `security.py`, `routers/auth.py`; `test_jwt_subject.py` | Changing an email doesn't log the user out; test | — |

| [ ] | 3.12 | Public landing page | agent; **owner** approves the copy | PRD F26, 04 Brief (landing exception) | `/` for signed-out visitors: hero, how it works, integrity features, who it's for, pricing placeholder, sign-up calls to action; responsive to 360 px; restrained scroll effects | Lighthouse 90+ on mobile and desktop; reduced motion fully static; no layout shift | 1.1 |
| [x] | 3.13 | Launch waitlist | agent; **owner** picks the sender address | PRD F27, AC22–AC23; 05 Schema `waitlist_signups` | `POST /waitlist` (public; rate-limited; same response whether new or existing; honeypot field against bots); `/waitlist` page in direction A; `manage_waitlist.py export` (CSV) and `send-launch` (uses `notify.py`, sets `notified_at`, includes unsubscribe link); `GET /waitlist/unsubscribe/{token}` | **AC22**, **AC23** pass; cross-check that no email is ever returned by the API | 2.3, 2.6 |
| [ ] | 3.14 | Product video slot on the landing page | agent; **owner** provides the YouTube link | PRD F28, AC24 | `PromoVideo` component: 16:9 frame; no link → "Video coming soon" placeholder; link set → `youtube-nocookie.com` thumbnail facade, iframe loaded on click; link read from `REACT_APP_PROMO_VIDEO_URL` | **AC24** passes; no third-party request until the visitor presses play | 3.12 |
| [ ] | 3.10 | "Get started" checklist for new organizations | agent | 03 App Flow first use | Checklist on the empty Exams page | Disappears when all 4 steps are done | 3.6 |

## Open issues

Record anything unresolved at a milestone checkpoint here: date, issue, decision needed, owner.

- 2026-10-12: Owner decisions pending: email provider (2.3), SMS gateway (3.9), hosting region (6.1), TestKori logo mark (1.1), negative-total policy (4.1), retakes (PRD open question 7), first global market and global pricing (PRD open questions 8–9), waitlist sender address (3.13), YouTube link for the product video (3.14).
- 2026-10-26: Security scan at the end of Milestone 2: Semgrep 0, Nuclei 0, ZAP on the API 0. ZAP on the frontend dev server flagged missing headers (dev server only) and a missing Content-Security-Policy, which was real. Fixed 2026-10-27: CSP + Permissions-Policy in `frontend/nginx.conf`, checked by CI and by walking the production build in a browser with zero violations.
- 2026-10-27: 3.2 decision (agent, documented in the TRD): questions students have met are locked rather than versioned in place; staff duplicate them to make a new version. Tell us if you'd rather have automatic versions.
- 2026-10-26: 2.3 built provider-neutral (SMTP). Owner still decides: which email provider, and the sender address/domain (needs SPF/DKIM on the domain). Until then the API writes emails to a local outbox.
- 2026-10-26: Remove the email-subject fallback for old tokens in `security.get_current_user` in the release after 2.8 ships (agent; no owner decision).
- 2026-10-28: 3.13 waitlist built. Still needed before `manage_waitlist.py send-launch` can run: the sender address (`EMAIL_FROM`, with SPF/DKIM) and the owner's approval of the launch email wording (placeholder in `backend/manage_waitlist.py`). Collecting signups needs neither.
- 2026-10-28: The landing prototype (`scrollcraft/builds/testkori-landing/`) now saves signups through `POST /waitlist`. When it's hosted, set `<meta name="testkori-api">` in `index.html` and `waitlist.html` to the API's public address and add the landing page's origin to the API's `CORS_ORIGINS`. Porting it into the app at `/` is task 3.12 (needs the owner's copy approval).
- 2026-10-26: The logo mark from 1.1 (option B, bubble + check) is in use; the owner picked it, so it's no longer pending.
